# **Strategies to Solve 530 Problems**

## **Finding MRS**
**1. Find the marginal utility of x and y, Ux and Uy, do not plug in numbers yet.** 

$$\bold{ U_x = \frac{dU}{dx}}$$
$$\bold{ U_y = \frac{dU}{dy}}$$ 

* Ux and Uy are derivatives of U with respect to x, y


**2. Find the marginal rate of substitution, note that it depends on your left hand side. Do not plug in numbers yet. What you found here will be your MRS formula for the problem.** 
- Solution 1: 
$$ \bold{\frac{dx}{\color{red}dy} = - \frac{\color{red}U_y}{U_x}}$$
- Solution 2:
$$ \bold{\frac{\color{red}dy}{dx} = - \frac{U_x}{\color{red}U_y}}$$

**3. Plug in values of x and y to the obtain numerical values of MRS.** 

**4. Interpretation of MRS. There are two possible ways.** 
- Base off of Solution 1:
$$ \bold {dx = - \frac{U_y}{U_x} \text{ } \color{red}dy} $$
$$ \bold {\text{To obtain an additional unit of $\color{red}y$, one must give up $\frac{U_y}{U_x}$ unit of x in order to maintain the same level of utility.}}$$
$$ \text{(Graphically, $\color{red}y$ will be on the horizontal axis, x on the vertical axis.)}$$

- Base off of Solution 2: 
$$ \bold {dy = - \frac{U_x}{U_y} \text{ } \color{red}dx} $$
$$ \bold {\text{To obtain an additional unit of $\color{red}x$, one must give up $\frac{U_x}{U_y}$ unit of y in order to maintain the same level of utility.}}$$
$$ \text{(Graphically, $\color{red}x$ will be on the horizontal axis, y on the vertical axis.)}$$
**5. Suppose something in the utility function changes, let's say, B.**
- Look at the MRS formula you got in step 3, ask yourself: when B goes up, is MRS going up or down?
- Incorporate that into the interpretation you found in step 4:

Because B goes up/down, to obtain an additional unit of $\color{red}y$,
one must give up more/less unit of x in order to maintain the same level of utility.

Because B goes up/down, to obtain an additional unit of $\color{red}x$,
one must give up more/less unit of y in order to maintain the same level of utility.
